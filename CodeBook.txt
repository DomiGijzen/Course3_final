Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Data prepping
=================
The following datasets are loaded into R and prepared as following below:
-Activity_labels.tx -> column names: "activity", "activity_name";
-Features.txt -> column names: "feature", "feature_name";
-y_test and y_train -> column names: "activity";
-subject_test and subject_train -> column names: "subject";
-X_test and X_train -> column names: the features.txt are used as column names;

The loaded datasets are combined as shown below:
-y_test and y_train are merged with the activity labels from Activity_labels.txt and named activity_test and activity_train;
-subject_test, activity_test and X_test are combind to one dataframe showing subject(id), activity and activity name and alle features and named testset (same for train data -> trainset);
-testset and trainset are combined to a totalset.

Analysis
=================
-From the totalset, all columns containing mean or std calculations and subject, activity and activityname are selected for further analysis and named extractset;
-The extractset is grouped per subject and activity;
-The grouped data is summarised using the mean-function;
-Summarised column are renamed with a prefix(Mean_of_);

Export
=================
The final analysis is exported with write.table function and named upload_table.txt.
